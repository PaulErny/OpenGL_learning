# Content
This project is composed of two git branches:  
  - The Master branch contains a working version on the project. In its actual state, you will found a 3D cube in an empty environment and a camera that can move in the 3D space with keyboard and mouse.  
  ***for this version to work, you will need pyOpenGL, pygame and numpy to be installed in your python environment***
  - The develop branch contains the same project but pygame has been entirely replaced by GLFW to that its no longer needed.
  ***for this version to work, you will need pyOpenGL, GLFW, GLM and numpy to be installed in your python environment***
  > ***please NOTE that the content of the develop branch is a susceptible to change and may not work until it's been pushed to the master branch***
